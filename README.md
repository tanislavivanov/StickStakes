# StickStakes

A stickman brawler for settling who pays. See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the
product; this file is the state of the code.

**Done so far:** the monorepo and netcode (step 1), the core match loop
(Track A), combat (Track B), the stakes layer (Track C) — room codes, the
join screen, host setup, and an end screen that names who pays — and
character customization: colour and hat, picked in the lobby. Up to 10
players per game.

## Repo shape

```
shared/   types, constants, the physics step BOTH sides run, and the wire schema
server/   Colyseus room, authoritative 30Hz fixed timestep
client/   Vite + canvas renderer + touch controls
scripts/  cloudflared quick tunnel + QR, for testing on a phone
test/     integration test that drives a whole match against a live server
```

`shared/` is the load-bearing one. `stepBody()` lives there and is called by the
server inside its fixed timestep *and* by the client's reconciler when it
replays unacknowledged inputs. The server's `Player` schema declares exactly the
fields of `PlayerBody`, so a decoded schema instance can be handed straight to
the shared step — there is a compile-time assertion in `shared/src/schema.ts`
that breaks the build if the two ever drift apart.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # shared (tsc --watch) + server :2567 + client :5173
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> in two tabs and you have two stickmen. Keyboard:
arrows or WASD to move, space to jump, J to attack (attack is wired end-to-end
but does nothing yet).

On touch, the left half of the screen is a floating stick: put a thumb down
anywhere in it and that spot becomes the origin, then drag right or left to run.
Drag far enough and the origin trails your thumb, so you can cross the whole
arena on one stroke and still turn around with a short flick. Nothing is drawn
there until you touch it. The right half keeps two real buttons, jump and
attack; both thumbs work at once.

### On a phone

```bash
npm run dev:phone      # same as `dev`, plus a Cloudflare quick tunnel + QR code
```

Scan the QR. You get HTTPS for free — which the fullscreen API, vibration,
screen-wake-lock and PWA install all require — and friends can join over
cellular, which matters when you are testing in a restaurant. Vite HMR works
through the tunnel. Quick-tunnel hostnames are random and change on every
restart, so the QR is regenerated each session.

Dev builds load [eruda](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda), so there is a
floating devtools console on the phone itself — no tethering to a laptop.

Other scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm start` (server only),
`npm run tunnel` (tunnel alone, against an already-running client).

### Testing

```bash
npm run dev          # in one terminal
npm run test:match   # in another
```

`test/match.mjs` connects two headless clients and plays a match to completion,
asserting the whole state machine: host-only start, countdown freeze, life loss,
respawn, elimination, round scoring, the match winner, and replay. It exits
non-zero on the first failure.

## The match loop

```
lobby ──host starts──> countdown ──> playing ──> roundOver ─┬─> countdown
  ^                                                          └─> matchOver
  └──────────────────── host plays again ────────────────────────┘
```

Three rounds, three lives each, first to two rounds takes the match. Fall off and
you lose a life, come back after ~1.2s with brief i-frames; at zero lives you sit
out the rest of the round. The round ends when one fighter is left standing.

The first player to join is the host and the only one whose start/replay button
does anything — the server checks the session id rather than trusting the client.
Join mid-match and you spectate until the next round. Alone in the room, a round
never ends, which makes it a practice mode you can test on one phone.

All match timing is in **server ticks**, not wall-clock: `phaseEndsAtTick` is
compared against the synced `tick`, so countdowns need no clock alignment and no
per-tick timer messages.

`frozen` is a synced field on each player that both the server step and the
client reconciler honour, so a countdown or a death freezes prediction in
lock-step with the server instead of rubber-banding against it.

## Getting into a game

The landing screen asks for a name, then either creates a game or joins one by
code. Creating gives you a **4-letter room code** — that's the room's actual
Colyseus id, replaced in `onCreate` and collision-checked against the
matchmaker, so `joinById(code)` needs no lookup table. The alphabet has no
I/O/0/1 in it, because these get read aloud across a noisy table.

The code also goes in the URL (`?code=ABCD`), so the host can share a link
instead of dictating letters, and a reload rejoins the same game.

Up to 10 players. The host — the first to join — sets rounds, lives, and the
**stake**: free text saying what's actually riding on the match. Everyone sees
it in the lobby, and the end screen repeats it back under the winner's name,
with final standings, a share button, and a split-the-bill helper.

That layer is a **joke tracker and nothing else**. No amounts are stored, sent
or settled; the split helper divides a number the user types and shows the
answer. The moment real money moves through it, it becomes a gambling product
with the app-store and payment-services rules that implies.

## Character customization

Everyone in the lobby — not just the host — picks their own colour and hat
from the "Your look" row: ten colours, six hats (including "none"). Both are
sent as one `customize` message and applied only to your own player; the
server ignores an attempt to touch anyone else's.

It's **lobby only**, the same way the match setup is: the picker only exists
on the lobby screen, which is itself only shown during `phase === "lobby"`,
and the server independently refuses `customize` outside that phase — a
colour and hat are how you spot a fighter mid-scrum, so they lock the moment
the countdown starts, same as the match won't quietly change its own rounds
or lives mid-fight.

Colours can't collide: the server refuses to hand out one someone else is
already wearing, so ten players always stay ten distinguishable silhouettes.
Hats have no such rule — purely cosmetic, so duplicates are fine.

## Combat

No health bars — you die by leaving the arena. Damage is purely a **knockback
multiplier**: launch speed is \`KNOCKBACK_BASE + damage × KNOCKBACK_SCALING\`, so
a fresh stickman barely budges and one at 120% flies off the map. That is what
makes a comeback possible, and what makes "he's at 140, don't let him touch you"
a real thing to shout across a table. Damage resets on every respawn.

A swing runs **startup → active → recovery**; only the active frames carry a
hitbox, so an attack is a commitment rather than a free button. A hit deals
damage, launches the target away from the attacker, and applies hitstun.

Hitstun is a synced \`stunned\` flag distinct from \`frozen\`: it takes the controls
away but leaves physics running, so you keep flying along the arc the hit gave
you. Because both sides honour it inside \`stepBody\`, the client reconciler
replays a knockback exactly as the server produced it.

Each target can be hit at most once per swing, so holding the button down does
not machine-gun damage. Fresh-spawn i-frames make you briefly unhittable.

## How the netcode fits together

One URL, one origin. The client always reaches Colyseus through a same-origin
`/colyseus` prefix that Vite proxies in dev, so a phone only ever learns one
hostname and there is no CORS and no mixed content behind an HTTPS tunnel.

- The server runs `setFixedTimestep(..., 30)`. One input frame == one fixed step
  == one broadcast tick. It consumes exactly one buffered input per player per
  step (`inputs.get(sid).next()`) — draining the buffer and applying only the
  newest would acknowledge inputs that were never simulated, and the client's
  replay would then disagree.
- Clients send **intent only** (`left`/`right`/`jump`/`attack`). No client ever
  sends a position.
- Remote stickmen are drawn ~100ms behind the newest snapshot and interpolated
  (`predict.attachAll("players", { x: "lerp", y: "lerp" })`).
- Your own stickman is reconciled: each input is applied locally the instant it
  is sent, and when server truth arrives the client rewinds to it and replays
  whatever is still in flight, through the same `stepBody`.

Both prediction and interpolation are read through one idiom,
`predict.value(player, "x")` — reconciled for you, interpolated for everyone
else.

## Not built yet

Weapons, the shrinking platform, the ledger, the PWA manifest, and
deployment. The attack
button swings but has no hitbox — Track B hangs one on the same
`attackUntilTick` window the animation already reads. Matter.js is not a dependency yet — the
character controller in `shared/src/physics.ts` is a deliberately small
deterministic AABB stepper, which is what prediction and replay need; Matter.js
comes in with ragdolls, where determinism matters less.
